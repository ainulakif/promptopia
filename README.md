# PORTFOLIO PROJECT

A [portfolio website application](https://ainulakif-website.vercel.app/) that I can use to showcase my projects in one place. I don't know if it's appropriate but currently this is what I want to do.

>This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It's also utilize [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for deployment and hosting of the web application.
